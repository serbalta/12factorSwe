I couldn't complete the containers because I couldn't keep up with the project. It shows in the additional branch but I didn't Merge it because it's not finished. 
So Execute has to be done manually. 

First we go to the doc directory.
```
docker-compose up -d
```
command to start the Cassandra Database.

Then, since the dockerFile is not complete, we will
```
1. config-server
2. account-service
3. admin-server
```
applications manually.
```
http://localhost:8500/
```
go to the link you can get detailed information about the status of services
